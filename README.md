# InfinityShare: Peer-to-Peer File Transfer

**Live Website: [https://infinityshare.netlify.app/](https://infinityshare.netlify.app/)**

InfinityShare is a web application for direct, secure, and private peer-to-peer (P2P) file transfers. Share files of any size directly between devices without uploading them to any server.

## How to Use InfinityShare

InfinityShare makes file transfer simple and quick:

**1. Sender:**

- Open [InfinityShare](https://infinityshare.netlify.app/) in your browser.
- Drag and drop files/folders you want to share into the "Send" area, or click to select them.
- A unique 4-character "Drive Code" and a QR code will be generated.
- Share this Drive Code or QR code with the receiver.

**2. Receiver:**

- Open [InfinityShare](https://infinityshare.netlify.app/) on another device.
- In the "Receive" section, enter the 4-character Drive Code provided by the sender and click "Join Drive".
- Alternatively, if the sender shared a direct link (which includes the drive code), opening that link will automatically attempt to join the drive.
- If you have a QR code scanner, you can scan the QR code displayed on the sender's screen to join.
- Once connected, you will see the list of shared files.
- Click the download icon next to a file/folder to download it, or use the "Download All" button to get all files as a single ZIP archive.

**Important Notes for Optimal Use:**

- **Network:** For the fastest transfer speeds, ensure both devices are on the **same local network** (e.g., connected to the same Wi-Fi router or hotspot). While transfers can work over the internet, local network connections are significantly faster.
- **Keep Tab Active:** Both the sender and receiver must keep the InfinityShare browser tab **open and active** for the duration of the transfer. Closing the tab or navigating away will interrupt the connection and stop the transfer.
- **Screen Sleep:** InfinityShare attempts to keep your device's screen awake during active use (sending or receiving) to prevent transfers from being interrupted, especially on mobile devices. This uses the `NoSleep.js` library.

**Progressive Web App (PWA) - Install for an App-Like Experience:**

InfinityShare is a PWA, meaning you can "install" it on your device for easier access and an experience similar to a native app.

- **Desktop (Chrome, Edge):**
  1.  Navigate to [https://infinityshare.netlify.app/](https://infinityshare.netlify.app/).
  2.  Look for an "Install" icon in the address bar (usually a computer with a down arrow).
  3.  Click it and follow the prompts to install.
- **Android (Chrome):**
  1.  Navigate to [https://infinityshare.netlify.app/](https://infinityshare.netlify.app/) in Chrome.
  2.  Tap the three-dot menu icon.
  3.  Select "Install app" or "Add to Home screen."
- **iOS (Safari):**
  1.  Navigate to [https://infinityshare.netlify.app/](https://infinityshare.netlify.app/) in Safari.
  2.  Tap the "Share" icon (a square with an upward arrow).
  3.  Scroll down and tap "Add to Home Screen."
  4.  Confirm by tapping "Add."

## Key Features

- **Direct P2P Transfers:** Files are sent directly between browsers using WebRTC, ensuring privacy and speed.
- **No Server-Side Storage:** Your files are never uploaded to or stored on any server.
- **Drag & Drop Uploads:** Easily add files and entire folder structures.
- **Drive Code & QR Sharing:** Simple sharing using a 4-character code or a scannable QR code.
- **URL-Based Joining:** Receivers can join directly via a shared URL.
- **Dynamic File Management:** Senders can add or delete files/folders, and the receiver's list updates in real-time.
- **Single File Downloads:** Efficient streaming downloads for individual files via a Service Worker.
- **"Download All" as ZIP:** Download all shared files or specific folders as a single ZIP archive, created in the browser.
- **Progress Indicators:** View progress, speed, and ETA for "Download All" and folder downloads.
- **Progressive Web App (PWA):** Installable on desktop and mobile for an app-like experience and offline access to the app shell.
- **Screen Wake Lock:** Actively works to prevent your device's screen from sleeping during transfers.
- **Secure:** Transfers are encrypted using DTLS (standard with WebRTC).

## Local Development Setup

Want to run InfinityShare locally or contribute? Hereâ€™s how:

**Prerequisites:**

- Node.js (v16 or later recommended)
- npm (usually comes with Node.js) or yarn

**Steps:**

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Shanmus4/infinityshare.git
    cd infinityshare
    ```

2.  **Install Root Dependencies (Optional - if any for monorepo tools):**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    _(Currently, the root `package.json` might only contain scripts for running client/server concurrently, actual dependencies are within sub-projects)._

3.  **Install Client Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    cd client
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Install Signaling Server Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    cd ../signaling-server
    npm install # express, twilio, dotenv will be installed
    ```

5.  **Environment Variables:**

    - **Signaling Server (`signaling-server/.env` - create this file):**
      - `PORT`: Port for the signaling server (e.g., `3000`).
      - `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`: Comma-separated list of client URLs allowed for CORS (e.g., `http://localhost:3001,https://your-app.netlify.app`).
      - `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`: Your Twilio Account SID (for TURN service).
      - `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`: Your Twilio Auth Token (for TURN service).
      - `SSL_CERT_PATH` (Optional for local HTTPS): Path to SSL certificate.
      - `SSL_KEY_PATH` (Optional for local HTTPS): Path to SSL private key.
    - **Client (`client/.env` - create this file):**
      - `REACT_APP_SIGNALING_SERVER_URL`: The URL of your signaling server. For local development:
        - If signaling server is HTTP on port 3000: `REACT_APP_SIGNALING_SERVER_URL=ws://localhost:3000`
        - If signaling server is HTTPS on port 3000: `REACT_APP_SIGNALING_SERVER_URL=wss://localhost:3000`

6.  **Running the Application:**

    - **Start the Signaling Server:**

      ```bash
      cd signaling-server
      node index.js
      ```

      (This typically runs `node index.js`. Keep this terminal running.)

    - **Start the React Client (in a new terminal):**
      ```bash
      cd client
      npm start
      ```
      This will usually open the app in your browser at `http://localhost:3001`.

## Project Architecture

InfinityShare consists of two main components:

1.  **React Frontend (`/client`):**

    - The user interface built with React.
    - Handles file selection, WebRTC connection setup, data channel management for file transfer, and all client-side logic (zipping, saving, PWA registration, NoSleep.js).
    - Communicates with the signaling server to exchange connection details with the peer.
    - Deployed on Netlify: [https://infinityshare.netlify.app/](https://infinityshare.netlify.app/)

2.  **Signaling Server (`/signaling-server`):**
    - A Node.js server using `socket.io` (for signaling) and `Express.js` (for API).
    - Relays WebRTC signaling messages (offers, answers, ICE candidates).
    - Provides an API endpoint (`/api/ice-servers`) that dynamically fetches temporary STUN/TURN credentials from Twilio using your secure Account SID and Auth Token.
    - **It does not handle or store any file data.** All file transfers are direct P2P if possible, or relayed via Twilio's TURN servers if necessary.
    - Deployed on Render: `wss://infinityshare.onrender.com` (signaling) and `https://infinityshare.onrender.com` (API for ICE servers).

**How it Works (WebRTC):**

- Peers connect to the signaling server.
- The client application fetches STUN and TURN server configurations (including temporary credentials for TURN) from an API endpoint on the signaling server.
- The signaling server relays SDP offers/answers and ICE candidates between peers.
- WebRTC's ICE process uses this information to attempt to establish the best possible connection:
    1. **Direct P2P (Host Candidates):** Tries to connect using local network IPs if peers are on the same network.
    2. **Direct P2P via NAT (Server Reflexive Candidates):** Uses STUN servers to discover public IPs and attempts a direct connection.
    3. **Relayed (TURN Candidates):** If direct P2P fails (due to restrictive firewalls/NATs), it falls back to using a TURN server to relay encrypted data between peers. This is provided by Twilio's Network Traversal Service.
- Once connected, files are transferred via encrypted `RTCDataChannel`s.
